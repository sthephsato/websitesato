<p><b>It is true, for Peru as well as most other South American countries; one can easily find hundreds of Peru travel agencies on the web. Therefore the question arises, how to choose the Peru travel agency that you feel comfortable doing business with and who you can trust to create an unforgettable vacation to Peru. As with other online purchases, there are several options and possibilities and all of these have their own prices based on the required level of quality amongst other factors; for Peru travel agencies this is the same. You can for instance find agencies that offer all-inclusive vacations to Peru, you can find agencies offering specialty trips in a specific region and you can find agencies that organize your entire packages according to your preferences.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore the first task is to have more or less clear what type of vacation you are looking for and how much you would like to have organized. Often people want to travel more adventurously while heading off with making only the minimum of arrangements and therefore would only need to buy some tickets such as the entrances to Machu Picchu, trains and domestic flights in advance. Nevertheless this does mean that even though you have most days free to do what you want, you do have to be at certain sites at certain days and some planning ahead is required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People coming to Peru and only having a limited amount of time and a large wish list, often are better off working with a Peru travel agency that organizes customizable trips based on their needs and preferences. This way you will not be wasting several parts of your day organizing the next day and therefore will be able to visit more in the same amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second part of the planning is to look at the type of accommodations you may be looking for. In case you would be considering staying in low budget hostels or bed and breakfasts, you may be better off booking this yourself online as there are often online offers that provide cheap accommodations even without reservations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For travelers staying in hotels in the 3 to 5* range they are often better off working with a Peru based agency as agencies based in the same country as the hotel can take advantage of confidential hotel prices that depending on the volume often range up to about 60% off the public (rack) prices. Taking into consideration the popularity of some cities and sites in Peru, it is also recommended to make reservations for higher end hotels as the popular ones do fill up quiet fast for the majority of the year especially in the high seasons. Therefore in this case it may be safer and less hassle to work with a locally based online Peru travel agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the above into consideration and you now have decided that you would like to use a local Peru travel agency, how those one chose between the many options?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all have a look around and compare different websites and the amount and quality of information they offer. Choose two or three and start researching the information they offer, the packages they work with and the reviews they have on their website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to find independent reviews for each of the agencies online (Tripatlas, Tripadvisor, Gogobot, etc…) and analyze these. Always be careful as it is always possible that the reviews are not necessarily unbiased and therefore it does not always mean the more the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact your Peru travel agencies of choice and see what the communication is like and their response times. How the level of English is, how is the actual knowledge of Peru and the details of your trip. Details such as train times, tour times and destinations and weather tips can give you a good impression of the actual knowledge and how up to date the agency is you are working with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Peru travel agencies will send you a proposal and quote so the next step is to analyze the quote. How clear is the tour and descriptions, how transparent is their pricing and the items included and not included. Have they included flights? A good agency should provide you with elaborated information about the hotels, tours, excursions and of course an overview of what is and what is not included. This you can compare with other quotes to see which is the more transparent combined with the best quote. It is also worth to have a look at the Terms and Conditions that each Peru travel agency offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before deciding on the travel agency to buy with, also consider the required deposit payment (deposit payments should not necessarily be over 30% of the entire package price) and the payment terms and options they offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If after this still in doubt, you can always write straight away to the agency and request some more information and reviews about the agency and their services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully these tips will help in finding the best Peru travel agency for your vacation to Peru.</span></p>

<p><b>Peru is a magical and unbelievably interesting vacation destination and for many people one of the most diverse countries they have ever visited. Peru’s large desert coastline, the central Andes running through the country and the vast region of the Amazon rain and cloud forests all represent different destinations, climates and cultures.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highlight for many people in their Peru vacation package is without a doubt Machu Picchu. Together with Cusco and the Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu is the attraction that is at the top of peoples lists when they come for a vacation to Peru. Nevertheless as a trip to Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu takes about 3-4 days, the questions arises, what other destinations may be possible when looking for a 10 day Peru vacation package?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where a lot of people get stuck in their holiday planning; Peru being such a vast country with such a diverse culture and having such a wide variety of destinations and attractions that it is not easy for first time visitors to have a clear idea of what to do in a 10 day Peru vacation package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As most visitors arrive in Lima and after Lima travel south to see Machu Picchu, the most logical destinations for a 10 day Peru vacation package are also located in the South. The top destinations in south Peru are Nazca with the famous Nazca Lines, Arequipa – Peru’s second city nicknamed the “White City”, the Colca Canyon arguably one of the deepest canyons on the planet and home to the condor bird, Lake Titicaca – the highest navigable lake in the world and of course the Rainforest with national parks such as Manu and Tambopata.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the former named places are easy to combine with a visit to Cusco and Machu Picchu and are only a few hours in bus or a short flight away. As it is not possible to see all these places in a 10 day Peru vacation package one will have to prioritize in order to decide on a final itinerary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to make clear what are the priorities are for a 10 day Peru vacation package is to go over some variables. These are the budget for your vacation, general interests when travelling, the activities you would like to do, the climate and the time of year.</span></p>
<p><b>Budget</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it is important to make clear for yourself what is the budget you would be willing to spend on a 10 day Peru vacation package. One can find 10 day Peru vacation packages starting from US$1,000 per person but this can also easily go up to several thousands of Dollars. This all depends on the level of hotel you would like, the type of excursions and of course the type of train you would like to take to Machu Picchu. On average one can count that a good quality 3* hotel costs around US$80 per night in Peru. 4* hotels can easily go up to US$150-200 per night meanwhile 5* hotels often charge around US$500 per night. Therefore it is important to have clear the level of hotel you would like to use as this is a big part of the package price.</span></p>
<p><b>General interests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; as Cusco &amp; Machu Picchu for most people are found quite high up on the list of things to see in Peru, it is obvious that Peru attracts a lot of people interested in history and ancient cultures. Nevertheless, Peru is much more than only the Incas. Peru is abundant with other ancient cultures and is home to one of the oldest civilizations in the Americas – Caral. Apart from the historical sites of the country, Peru also holds some of the most spectacular landscapes you can imagine such as the Colca Canyon, Lake Titicaca and of course the Amazon Rainforest. Finally there is of course the chance to see wildlife in Peru, more particular in the Rainforest. Therefore having clear what your priorities are for a 10 day Peru vacation package helps a lot in putting together the places you would like to discover.</span></p>
<p><b>Activities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Apart from the different places to visit, Peru also offers a ton of things to do. The country is renowned for its hiking possibilities, jungle excursions, bird watching tours, river rafting, mountaineering, biking, horse-riding, surfing, and sand boarding possibilities. These types of activities can be added to a 10 day Peru vacation package but as these are done in different regions it is important to have clear the activities of interest and then finding out how to add these to your itinerary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally we have to think in the </span><b>time of year and the climate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that goes with that time of year. As Peru is mainly divided into two seasons; the dry and wet season it is important to keep this in mind. The wet season runs from December through March and is mainly felt in the highlands and the jungle. Visiting the coast during the wet season means you have the chance to enjoy the warm and dry summer months in this period. The dry season (April through November) is ideal to visit the highlands and the jungle region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have clear, the interests and the things you would like to get out of your 10 day Peru vacation package you can start planning on destinations, modes of transport and the time of year to visit.</span></p>

<p><b>The most famous falls in the world are without a doubt the Niagara Falls in North America, the Victoria Falls in Africa and the Iguassu Falls in South America. The Iguassu Falls, located on the tri-frontier between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay are probably the best known on the continent due to their sheer size and the large number of individual falls comprising these magnificent falls.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless South America has so much more to offer when it comes to waterfalls. Few know that the highest falls in the world, with a free drop of 979 meters- the Angel Falls, are located in the South of Venezuela. Part of the reason they are not widely known is that these falls are hard to reach due to almost non existent infrastructure and the dense jungle surrounding the area.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even lesser known are the Peruvian Gocta falls located in North Peru around Chachapoyas. The Gocta Falls have been known in the area for centuries but it was not until 2002 that a German engineer truly saw the size of the Gocta Falls and measured that they could easily fall into the top ten highest falls on earth. The Peruvian Government sent out an official visit measuring the falls. They measured the falls to be 771 meters high. The falls are divided in two sections with the tallest section measuring 540 meters. When taking into account the complete height of the falls, the falls rank 14th among the world’s highest falls. When taking into account the height of the highest single fall the Gocta Falls rank 17th.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falls are fed from the Peruvian Andes making that the falls have water all year round. Nevertheless the water level in the rainy season is much higher than in the dry season. The falls are located in an area about 2800 meters above sea-level which is known for its virgin rainforest. The region is not widely travelled and one of the true unknown gems Peru has to offer to outdoor enthusiasts. The closest city is the city of Chachapoyas at about 5 hours walking. The walk will take you through amazing rain and cloud forests pass dozens of other waterfalls and through areas with an abundant fauna and flora.  Chachapoyas is also known for the closely located ruins of Kuelap, one of the few remnants of the Chachapoyas culture, one of the few that resisted against the Inca. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area has not been developed for tourism as much as the South of Peru but this makes it all the more challenging to visit the region and enjoy the amazing diversity of countryside, people, nature and culture. North Peru with its Gocta falls definitely a region not to be missed. </span></p>

<p><b>Peru is the proud owner of the second largest area of the Amazon Rainforest only losing out to Brazil. Almost 60% of Peru is made up out of both subtropical cloud forests and tropical jungles. Nevertheless only 8% of the country’s population lives in these regions. The regions boasts forests as far as the eye can see, only now and then interrupted by a river running snake-wise through the forests. The region holds the largest selection of wildlife in Peru and is world-renowned for its amount of birds and reptiles.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a lot of people these are all reasons for visiting the area and experiencing what it is to spend some time in these deep and dense forests. As the number of people interested increases, the number of great lodges and retreats also increases. In Peru the two most famous cities from which to visit the surrounding rainforest are Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado. Iquitos is located in the far north of Peru on the banks of the Amazon River. It is the second biggest jungle city in the world after Manaus (Brazil), located about 5 days down the Amazon River. Puerto Maldonado is located in the South of Peru close to the border with Bolivia and Brazil. Both destinations provide great jungle excursion possibilities and places for wildlife spotting. Nevertheless there are small differences between the two cities and areas.</span></p>
<p><b>Puerto Maldonado</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puerto Maldonado, located in the south of Peru has due to its location gained quite some importance when it comes to having great lodges and amazingly accessible rainforest. The city of Puerto Maldonado is a relatively small town located at the confluence of the Madre de Dios and Tambopata Rivers. The city is reached by road or by plane from Lima or Cusco. The road from Cusco takes about 10 hours by bus, the main reason why most people fly to Puerto Maldonado. The flights departs from Lima with a short stop in Cusco. The flight takes about 2 hours from Lima and an hour from Cusco. There are several flights daily with different airlines. Therefore the area is easily reachable from Cusco and Machu Picchu. As the city is quite small, access to the rainforest is only an hour by boat. Nearby are the Manú National Park, Tambopata National Reserve, and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park. These are some of the most pristine primary rain forests in the world, which include several oxbow lakes and clay licks, where hundreds of birds including macaws feed on clay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several lodges to be found ranging from basic to the more luxurious lodges all located close to either Manu or Tambopata National park. The lodges are in most cases built with local materials and with respect for the surrounding forests. As the lodges are located close to the parks, excursions can be done from the lodge, also making it possible to return to the lodges for lunch and dinner. This also results that in general a greater number of different types of excursions are possible in one day. Typical excursions done with most lodges in the Tambopata or Manu area are; canopy walkways, bird watching excursions, short jungle hikes, excursions to oxbow lakes and clay licks, fishing excursions (piranhas), evening excursions and lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of days for a jungle lodge stay in the Puerto Maldonado area range from 3 to 8 days. Most people do a 3 or 4 day stay in one of the lodges closer to Puerto Maldonado, these lodges are reached with a 1 or 2 hour boat drive. The Amazon packages that consist of more than 5 days often use lodges further into the jungle and reached by boat taking up to 3 or 4 hours.</span></p>
<p><b>Iquitos;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iquitos is probably one of the most famous jungle cities together with Manaus and makes for a very interesting city due to its size and importance for the region. Being such a large city with the most important airfield in the region and direct access to the Amazon River further into Peru or downstream to Brazil and Colombia, the city makes for a large trade hub for imports and exports. The city has several interesting sites such as the Iron House built by Eifel which was completely imported or the Floating Market of Belen, one of the most entertaining markets in South America. Nevertheless the most popular attraction of Iquitos is the Amazon River and the surrounding Amazon rainforests. As Iquitos is located in the far north of the country, it is only reachable by river or plane and do Iquitos is somewhat out of the way for people coming from Machu Picchu. As boat travel can be a multi-day experience, most people fly to Iquitos from Lima. The flight takes about 2 hours and there are several flights daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iquitos is home to about 500,000 people and therefore quite a big city. Being such a sizeable city the city expands far into the surrounding forests and due to industry a lot of the surrounding lands are being deforested. Therefore in the direct surrounding of Iquitos there are not too many lodges found and even less natural parks. Most lodges are found about 2 hours downriver from Iquitos and several about 3-4 hours upriver from Iquitos. Some of the lodges downriver are quite fancy and come with all amenities of a hotel such as multiple restaurants, swimming pools and electricity. These lodges are nice to spend time in but do not offer the real jungle feel the lodges upriver from Iquitos or in the Puerto Maldonado do offer. Therefore the best lodges to visit for some true jungle feel in Iquitos are the lodges upriver from Iquitos. These lodges are located at quite some hours in boat making them less adequate for short jungle stays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, if you have a keen interest in knowing the Amazon Rainforest and have the time, the lodges here provide great experiences. Keep in mind that the lodges due to their location are much more basic than the ones downriver or in Puerto Maldonado but that wildlife spotting is almost guaranteed. These lodges also offer camping trips into the jungle. Keep in mind though that these lodges mostly do not offer packages fewer than 4 or 5 days. As you will also need one day to fly from Lima (or Cusco) to Iquitos, one would need about one week for a good jungle excursion in the Iquitos area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puerto Maldonado on the other hand does provide good lodges and great wildlife spotting on only a few hours from Cusco making it a much more adequate destination for shorter jungle excursions. In any case being such an elaborate part of Peru and Peruvian culture, the Amazon Rainforest, whether it is Iquitos or Puerto Maldonado, is an experience that rewards the travel efforts to get there and for many people provides the highlights of their Peru vacation package.</span></p>

</div><p><b>When thinking about Carnival in South America most people immediately envision this with Brazilian Samba dancers in Rio de Janeiro. Nevertheless there are more Carnivals with an even higher historic value in South America. Around the same time as the Carnivals in Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Barranquilla reach their critical points; in the South American highlands Carnivals with other significance can be found. In Bolivia one can find the Carnival or Oruro and in Peru the Carnival of La Virgen de La Candelaria taking place in Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca. The last two, together with the Rio Carnival are seen as the largest yearly festivities on the continent. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the year Puno is known as the pass through city when visiting Lake Titicaca, located at 3811 meters above sea level, it is the highest navigable lake on the planet. The lake is dotted with beautiful islands still inhabited by people holding firm to their Inca heritance. The lake is surrounded by snowcapped mountains reflecting in the dark blue waters making for some of the most beautiful vacation pictures. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless in February, the lake and its islands are no longer the main reason to come to Puno. In the first weeks of February, Puno reclaims its fame for being the folkloric capital of Peru and the widely popular Fiesta de la Virgin de La Candelaria is celebrated. Also known as the Carnival of Puno, this yearly festival this year starts on February 2 and lasts for a whole week with the final day February 7 as the highlight of the week. The Virgen de La Candelaria is Puno’s Patron Saint and is celebrated typically in this region. The Peruvian Andes after being conquered by the Spanish in the 16th Century made it one of their strengths to combine the (imposed) religion brought by the Spanish with their local Aymara and Quechua traditions and celebrations. The Puno carnival is in Peru the most recognized form of this celebration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The festival is centered on the worshipping of the Virgin who is carried from the main church on the shoulders of dozens of strong men all around the city in a large parade. This central celebration goes hand in hand with tens of other parades going on around the city honoring the Virgin in more traditional ways. The secondary parades are made up out of local dancing groups and groups from other parts of the country invited by the local groups. They all have several themes and characters that come from century old traditions and represent several figures out of the Inca and Colonization times. The most famous is “La Diablada”, a dance that represents the evil that is chased away by the Virgin. The dance is centered on La Diabla, a female form of the Devil. The dancers are dressed up in original and highly detailed costumes that represent Saints, Puma’s, Bears and Condors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact origin of the dance is not completely clear and highly disputed. It is clear that the tradition comes from the Aymara as there are known writings about the Carnival dating back to 1556 by the hand of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, one of the most famous chroniclers of Inca times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all makes La Fiesta de la Candelaria an unforgettable spectacle that will keep people for days in Puno, enjoying the dances and the enthusiastic rhythms, which will stay with you even long after you have left Puno.</span></p>

</div><p><b>Being such a large continent reaching all the way from Colombia to the far South of Argentina, for many people it may sound a little crazy to visit the best sites this continent has to offer in two weeks. True the South American continent has enough highlights and amazing destinations to keep you busy for years but when focusing on the absolute highlights one can do a lot in South America in and around 2 weeks. So when looking to come to Peru, why not look a little further and perhaps include another unique South American destination?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s first try to come up with 2 worldwide recognized highlights for each of the main touristic countries in South America. Following is the list I would make;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecuador; the Galapagos Islands and Quito</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru; Machu Picchu and the Amazon Rainforest</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile; the Atacama Desert and the Torres del Paine National Park</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina; Buenos Aires and Patagonia (Perito Moreno Glacier)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brasil; Rio de Janeiro and the Iguazú Falls             </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In about 2 weeks’ it is possible to combine any three of the above destinations into one full blown trip. As we often get inquiries for 2 week trips to South America that are a combination of several of the highlights this continent has to offer, following you can find some of the most popular routes that combine at least 3 of the above destinations in 2 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru and Ecuador; we often have travelers asking to take the following route; a cruise around the Galapagos Islands, a couple of days in Quito and from here continue on to Peru. In Peru they would visit Cusco and Machu Picchu, ending with a 3 day jungle excursion to the Amazon Rainforest.</span></p>

	</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru and Chile; enjoy a couple of days in Peru visiting Lima, Cusco, the Sacred Valley and of course Machu Picchu; From Lima continue on to Santiago de Chile for a several days visit to the Atacama Desert (the driest desert on the planet), from where you will continue to the far South and visit the Torres del Paine National park before returning to Santiago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru and Argentina; After having visited beautiful Cusco and Machu Picchu, you will fly via Lima to Buenos Aires and spend a couple of days in the “Paris of South America”. From here you can either visit Patagonia in the far south of the continent, exposing amazing sites such as the Perito Moreno (the world’s only advancing glacier) and Ushuaia, the Southernmost city in the world. Alternatively you could also opt-in to visit the Iguazu Falls instead of Patagonia after Buenos Aires.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile and Argentina; this would be what we call the Southern Cone route. This trip would take you either from Santiago to Buenos Aires or reverse. In this 2 week trip you would visit the capital of Chile, Santiago de Chile from where you could either head South to Patagonia or North to the Atacama Desert. After these visits you can either fly into Argentina or take a bus to Mendoza or from Patagonia cross into the Argentinean Patagonia and visit the incredible Perito Moreno Glacier before heading further south to Ushuaia. Another possibility is to cross into Argentina via the Lake District around Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas. From here you have some amazing crossings to Bariloche, a beautiful picturesque city in Buenos Aires. Bariloche apart for being known as a great outdoors area is also one of the best places to ski in South America. From the Southern part of Argentina you can than fly to Buenos Aires for the last couple of days in this amazing metropolitan city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru and Brazil; for people wanting to combine a great actve vacation with some days also relaxing at the beach, one of the better combinations would to join Peru and Brazil for a 2 week South America vacation. Start off with a week in Peru visiting highlights such as Lima, Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu after which you will fly from Lima to Foz do Iguaçu for a visit to the Iguaçu Falls. After the falls you can fly to Rio de Janeiro and either enjoy this city or drive a little south to the beaches of Angra Dos Reis or Buzios for a couple of days doing nothing at some of the best beaches on the continent.</span></p>

<p><strong>Upon arriving to a new country, there is often at the start of your trip those somewhat awkward or uncomfortable moments every traveler will have to go through. One of those moments is to recognize when a tip is required and once you have figured this out, the next million dollar question; how much to tip.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru does not have the same approach to tipping as in the US for instance but for many local people this does represent a large part of their income and therefore is good practice when on vacation in Peru. The Peruvian approach is a merit-based approach but does come with some kind of minimal expected tip for different services.</span></p>

<h4>Share This With The Rest Of Your Party</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore on average one can say that if you are happy with the service provided you can tip a “standard” tip. In case you were more than happy with the service you can increase the tip based on your judgment. In case you are not happy with the service you can go under the “standard” tip. In case you would feel that no service is delivered you should of course feel free to abstain from tipping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before indicting some standard tips, I would also like to point out that in countries such as Peru were US Dollars are also accepted besides the local Peruvian Sol, it is always better to tip in the local currency. First of all this gives you more freedom in deciding the amount of the tip as this currency denomination is expressed in smaller quantities. Secondly this allows you to tip for smaller services such as bellboys or airport transfers without having to request change in return. Finally it is also much more appreciated by the people receiving the tips as they do not have to worry about the exchange rates. Saying that however, the US dollar will be happily received, particularly for larger amounts.</span></p>
<p><b>Tour Guides</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your tour guides that do the actual guiding during an excursion, the standard amount is of US$10 (25 Soles) per person for a day long excursion. If you would be doing a half day excursion you can cut this amount to about US$7-8 (15-20 Soles) per person. In case your guide went out of his way to help you or did an outstanding job, you can increase this amount of course. In case you would have received a service which you feel was not up to standard, feel free to cut these amounts in half. If you will be travelling with the same guide for several days you do not have to tip him every day, just indicate that you will provide them with a tip at the end of the service. In the case where you would have a private tour, these tips per person can be increased if you are content with the service. </span></p>
<p><b>Tour Drivers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On most tours and excursions you will be accompanied not only by a guide but also by a driver. If a driver does a good job, his work will go mostly unnoticed. Drivers often have a difficult job as they are in charge of your safety and often have to manage difficult roads.  For drivers the average tip is about US$5-7 (15-20 Soles) for a full day tour. For airport pickups tips are less expected but if the driver has helped with the luggage, good advice and maybe helped with your check in, a tip is recommended. For a transfer of about an hour a tip of about US$2-3 (5-10 Soles) is the norm. For shorter transfers this amount can easily be cut to US$1-2 (5 Soles).</span></p>
<p><b>Trekking Guides</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trekking guides are used to not being tipped every day on a multi-day trek. They know that their tip will be handed over at the end of the hike. Trekking guides do provide a 24 hour service while guiding you on a trek and therefore the tips for trekking guides is somewhat higher than normal tour guides. On average a tip of US$10- 15 per day is expected. In the case where you would have a private tour, these tips per person can be increased if content with the service. </span></p>
<p><b>Porters &amp; Cooks</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a multiday hike, your group will most of the time also be accompanied by some porters to carry the camping equipment and a cook, in charge of putting your meals on the table. Porters can also be tipped at the end of the hike and as their job is essential to a good hike and is one of the lesser recognized jobs a tip of US$5 (10-15 Soles) per person per porter is advised. For the cooks it will be easier to appreciate their work as you will have to eat their “grub” every day several times. A good cook does make a difference on a multiday hike and therefore it is recommended to tip them somewhere in the US$10-25 per person for a 4 day hike.</span></p>
<p><b>Hotels</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hotels, especially the higher end hotels, a tip is expected by the bellboys who help you with your luggage. Tips of US$1-2 (5 Soles) are the norm.</span></p>
<p><b>Restaurants</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In small local restaurants tips are not often expected but if you do leave a small tip of about 2-3 Soles, these are appreciated. For tourist restaurants, minimal tips of about 10% of the bill are expected. However, in case you were happy with the service and food, feel free to increase this percentage. In case you were not happy it goes without saying that this can be expressed with a lower tip.</span></p>
<p><b>Taxis</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taxis in Peru do not expect a tip for a normal taxi ride. As very few taxis in Peru have meters, the fee is agreed on before taking the drive and taxi drivers will often automatically charge more to tourists. Therefore a tip is absolutely unnecessary. In case you do request some additional service from the taxi driver after agreeing on the fee (waiting, detour, etc…) a little extra is recommended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that even though the information above is correct at the time of publishing, this can change over time. In general it is important that you feel comfortable with tipping and the amount. If you are in a group tour it is often recommended to gather the tips from the group and hand them to the guide as a group. This way you can also see if your tip is much higher or lower than the rest of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally; when dealing with gratuities on a vacation to Peru, the following golden rules are helpful to keep in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only pay when you want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all this talk of giving the perfect gratuity, don't forget that nobody should expect a tip. Don't feel obliged to provide anything if you have not been satisfied with the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, at the same time...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be nice!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the service isn't great, or even good, consider leaving a tip. Customs and language barriers are just a few of the circumstances that may prevent you from seeing the situation in its entirety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have amazing and a safe journey in this amazing country!!!</span></p>
